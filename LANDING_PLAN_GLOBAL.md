## 1. Product Value Analysis

### 1.1 Core Value Proposition

**"Know how your audience feels before you publish"**

| Problem | Percepta Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| Can't predict content performance | AI personas simulate target audience reactions |
| Feedback collection is slow & expensive | Real-time feedback, $0.01 per response |
| Relying on gut feeling | Quantified sentiment, purchase intent, scores |
| FGI/surveys are heavy processes | Get 5+ feedbacks in under 5 minutes |

### 1.2 Competitive Advantages

1. **Price**: $0.01 per feedback (1/100th of alternatives)
2. **Speed**: Real-time results (vs. days for FGI)
3. **Flexibility**: Unlimited persona combinations
4. **Quantification**: Sentiment, purchase intent, and scores as data

### 1.3 Core Pain Point We Solve

```
"I don't know how my target audience will react to my content"
```

- **Indie Hackers**: "Will this landing page convert?"
- **Copywriters**: "Will this headline resonate with 25-34 females?"
- **Content Creators**: "Will my audience engage with this?"
- **E-commerce Sellers**: "Will this product description drive sales?"

### 3.3 Section Details

#### Hero Section

**Headline Options** (for A/B testing)

| Option | Headline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| A | **"Test your copy on AI personas. $0.01 per feedback."** | Price-anchoring |
| B | **"Know how your audience feels before you publish"** | General |
| C | **"Skip the focus group. Get instant customer feedback."** | Startups |
| D | **"Would your target customer buy this?"** | Question-style |

**Subheadline**
> AI personas simulate your target customers' reactions.
> Get sentiment, purchase intent, and actionable insights in seconds.

**CTA Buttons**
- Primary: "Try Free — 30 Credits"
- Secondary: "See Demo" (scroll trigger)

#### Social Proof Section (NEW for Global)

**Trust Indicators**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  "Used by indie hackers and copywriters      │
│   to validate 10,000+ pieces of content"     │
│                                              │
│  [Product Hunt Badge]  [Twitter mentions]    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Matters Globally:**
- Western audiences expect social proof
- Product Hunt badge = instant credibility for indie hackers
- Can add later: testimonials, company logos

#### Problem Section

**"Sound familiar?"**

| Icon | Problem | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Target | No idea if it resonates | "Will 25-34 year olds actually care about this headline?" |
| Money | Expensive to find out | "User testing costs $49+. FGI costs thousands." |
| Clock | Too slow to iterate | "Can't wait days for feedback on every version" |

#### Demo Section (CRITICAL)

**Show Real Feedback Example**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [INPUT] Your content                             │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │

│ │  Sign up now and get 50% off your first     │ │
│ │  month!"                                     │ │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                      ↓                           │
│ [OUTPUT] AI Persona Feedback                     │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Sarah (28, Marketing Manager, ENFP)          │ │
│ │ ────────────────────────────────────────────  │ │
│ │ "New year discounts are everywhere. What     │ │
│ │  makes this different? I'd need to see       │ │
│ │  specific benefits before clicking."         │ │
│ │                                              │ │
│ │ Sentiment: Neutral | Intent: Low | Score: 2.5│ │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Mike (35, Software Engineer, ISTJ)           │ │
│ │ ────────────────────────────────────────────  │ │
│ │ "50% off is compelling, but 'healthy habits' │ │
│ │  is vague. What exactly am I signing up for?"│ │
│ │                                              │ │
│ │ Sentiment: Positive | Intent: Medium | 3.2   │ │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Purpose of This Section**
- Instant understanding: "Oh, this is how it works"
- Desire trigger: "I want to try this with my content"
- Trust building: "The feedback actually makes sense"

#### How It Works

```
① Upload Content        ② Select Personas       ③ Get Feedback
Text / URL / File   →   Choose 5+ personas  →   Instant results
```

**Key Points**
- "Done in under 5 minutes"
- "30 free credits on signup"

#### Pricing Section

**Simple, Non-threatening**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         1 feedback = $0.01              │
│                                         │
│   [Free]        [Basic]      [Pro]      │
│  30 credits    200 credits  500 credits │
│     $0           $2           $5        │
│                                         │
│   * 5 persona feedbacks + summary = 6   │
│   * That's just $0.06 for full analysis │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pricing Psychology**
- "$0.01" is memorable and feels like nothing
- Compare to: UserTesting ($49+), FGI ($500-5,000)
- "6 cents for 5 feedbacks" = instant no-brainer

#### Final CTA Section

**Urgency/Scarcity**

> Start free today — 30 credits included
> No credit card required

**Buttons**
- "Get Started Free"
- (If pre-launch) "Join Waitlist" + email input

## 4. First 5 Customers Acquisition Strategy

### 4.1 Channel Strategy (Global)

| Channel | Target | Action | Expected Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Product Hunt** | Indie Hackers, Early Adopters | Launch + upvote campaign | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Indie Hackers** | Solo Founders | Building in public + case study | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **X (Twitter)** | Tech/Marketing | Demo GIFs + threads | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Reddit** | Various | r/marketing, r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **LinkedIn** | B2B | Personal branding + tool showcase | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### 4.2 Product Hunt Launch Strategy

**Pre-Launch (1-2 weeks before)**
- Build anticipation on X/Twitter
- Collect early supporters for launch day
- Prepare assets: logo, screenshots, demo video

**Launch Day Checklist**
- [ ] Compelling tagline (under 60 chars)
- [ ] 4-6 high-quality screenshots/GIFs
- [ ] Demo video (under 2 min)
- [ ] First comment from maker (story + ask)
- [ ] Respond to every comment quickly

**Post-Launch**
- Share results on Indie Hackers
- Write "How I launched on Product Hunt" thread
- Convert interest into signups

### 4.3 Indie Hackers Strategy

**Content Types That Work**

1. **Building in Public Updates**
   - "Week 3: Got my first paying customer"
   - "How I built AI personas for $X"

2. **Problem-Solution Posts**
   - "I was spending $500 on focus groups..."
   - "How I validate landing page copy now"

3. **Milestone Celebrations**
   - "Just hit 100 users"
   - Revenue milestones

**Example Post**

```
Title: I built a tool to test copy on AI personas ($0.01/feedback)

Hey IH!

I kept launching things without knowing if the copy would
resonate. Focus groups were too expensive, asking friends
felt biased.

So I built Percepta — AI personas that give you honest
feedback on your content.

- Upload any text/URL
- Select target personas (age, job, personality)
- Get sentiment, purchase intent, and specific feedback

Currently in beta. 30 free credits for IH members.

Would love feedback on the landing page too (ironic, I know).

```

### 4.4 X (Twitter) Strategy

**Content Formats**

1. **Demo GIFs** (15-30 sec)
   - Show: input → persona selection → feedback output
   - Caption: "Testing landing page copy in 30 seconds"

2. **Before/After Threads**
   - "I tested 5 headlines on AI personas. Here's what happened:"
   - Show feedback for each, reveal winner

3. **Hot Takes**
   - "Stop asking friends to review your copy"
   - "FGI is dead. Here's what I use instead."

### 4.5 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Waitlist signups | 100 | Email collection |
| Trial conversion | 25% | Signup → first feedback |
| Payment conversion | 10% | Free credits exhausted → paid |
| **Paying customers** | **5** | Actual payment completed |

### 4.6 Feedback Loop

```
Week 1: Launch landing page + Product Hunt
        ↓
Week 2: Collect early user feedback
        ↓
Week 3: Iterate on landing/UX
        ↓
Week 4: Hit 5 paying customers
```

### 5.2 Positioning Statement

```
For indie hackers and copywriters who need fast,
affordable feedback on their content,

Percepta is an AI feedback tool that simulates
target customer reactions,

Unlike expensive focus groups or slow surveys,

We provide instant sentiment analysis, purchase
intent, and actionable feedback for just $0.01.
```

### 5.3 Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **Price**: "1 cent per feedback" (memorable anchor)

3. **Specificity**: "Feedback from YOUR target persona"
4. **Actionability**: "Not just scores — actual comments"

## 6. Implementation Plan

### 6.1 Landing Page Rebuild

Since the existing `landing-web/` can be fully rebuilt:

**Recommended Approach**
1. Keep React + Vite + Tailwind stack (proven, fast)
2. Maintain i18n structure (en/ko support)
3. Redesign sections per this strategy
4. Add analytics tracking from day 1

**Key Changes from Current**
- Add Social Proof section
- Redesign Hero with price anchoring
- Enhance Demo section with interactive feel
- Simplify pricing display
- Stronger CTAs throughout

### 6.2 Files to Create/Modify

```

```

### 6.3 Analytics Setup

**Track These Events**

- `demo_scroll` - Did they see the demo?
- `pricing_view` - Did they reach pricing?
- `signup_start` - Clicked signup
- `signup_complete` - Finished signup
